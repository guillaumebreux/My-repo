This plugin will allowed you to create a smooth one page design.

- Use a class for your menu and set his name properly. (default: ".mainmenu").
- Add a sticky class in your CSS to make the menu stick at the top of the page.
- For every link that have an anchor, insert the proper class (.smoothLink is the default class)
- You can set a timing for you smoothScroll duration (default: 800ms)
- You can use a returnTop button by setting 'returnTop' as true.
- Same for the highlight menu by setting 'activeMenu' as true. Don't forget to add the "anchor" class on every menu links that target an anchor.

This will call the plugin:
  $(document).jqueryOnepage(
      {
          'returnTop':true,
          'activeMenu':true
      }
  );
  
others options:
      'menuClass'       : '.mainmenu', //this is the class of your main menu.
      'stickClass'      : 'stick', //change the name of your sticky class (without dot or #). You'll need to stylise it in a certain way to make it work.
      'smoothClass'     : '.smoothLink', //Add this class for every links you want to smooth. (don't forget the related anchor)
      'timeSmooth'      : 800, //Change the duration of the smoothscroll
      'returnTop'       : false, //set true if you want a returnTop button appears after scrolling a bit.
      'returnClass'     : 'a.returntop', //if returnTop is true, add your sylized class for a personnal returnTop button
      'activeMenu'      : false, //set true if you want a highlight class to show to visitor where they currently are in the page.
      'linkActiveClass' : 'active', //add your class (without dot or #) for a sylized highlight class.
      'anchorClass'     : '.anchor'//add this class or change the name but you'll need to add this for every anchor link on your main menu for highlighting them.
